# Simple-Calculator


A simple calculator in JavaScript is a project that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using a web interface.

Here are the basic components and functionalities you'll typically include:

HTML Structure: Create an interface using HTML elements like buttons and a display area. Buttons represent numbers, operators, and actions like 'equals' and 'clear'.

JavaScript Logic: Write JavaScript code to handle user interactions and perform calculations. You'll use event listeners to detect button clicks and perform corresponding actions.

User Input Handling: Capture user input (button clicks) and display it on the calculator interface, allowing users to input numbers and operators.

Performing Calculations: Implement functions to carry out basic arithmetic operations based on user input. For instance, functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Displaying Results: Update the display area with the calculated result when the user clicks the 'equals' button.

Clear Functionality: Implement a function to clear the input or reset the calculator's state.
